# SafeClaude

Run Claude Code safely inside Docker. Restrict host access to a minimum — only the designated workspace directory is writable.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shi3z/safeclaude/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Requirements

- Docker
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

## Usage

```bash
# Start in current directory
safeclaude

# Start in a specific project directory
safeclaude ~/projects/myapp

# Add read-only directories
safeclaude ~/projects/myapp -r ~/projects/shared-lib -r ~/data
```

## Security Model

| Target | Container Path | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace directory | `/workspace` | Read-Write |
| Directories specified with `-r` | `/readonly/<name>` | Read-Only |
| All other host files | Not mounted | No access |

- Host filesystem is **not** mounted by default, minimizing data leakage risk
- Network is enabled (needed for pip install, npm install, etc.) but accessible data is restricted
- Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` inside the container

## Options

```
-b, --build     Force rebuild Docker image
-r, --ro-dir    Add read-only directory (can be specified multiple times)
-h, --help      Show help
```
